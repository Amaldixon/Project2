Project two required the introduction of JavaScript along with HTML and CSS to create an interactive webpage. By using the knowledge from the last project designing a website now had an extra step to it by adding JavaScript, my original idea for this project was to create a game within the website. I first had to plan how to create a game by using videos on YouTube to give me some sort of guidelines whilst working on the project, so that I could get the general gist of how I wanted to structure the game's code.

The project was first intended to be a "rock, paper, scissor, lizard, Spock". I was very confident at first going into the project however it did take up a lot of time to debug after multiple issues kept arising which rendered the project unusable. I was unable to trigger an event when the button was clicked it would start the game, the rules followed the same principle that the original 'rock, paper, scissor' follows however with a couple of extra steps, a score was to be kept till the winner reached "5 points" then the option to reset the game would be available. Due to the issues that that was found I had to start over again.

The second try at the project was a far simpler game, a coin toss game the reason why I went through with this idea is that it follows a very similar construct with the idea that when a button is clicked it triggers an event to begin the game however for this instant it's a coin toss of "heads" and "tails" instead of "rock, paper, scissor,(etc)". I set it to an alert to pop up letting the player know what side the coin has landed on, along with this depending on what side was pick the alert will let the player know if they won for picking the right side or if they had lost if the coin had not landed on the chosen side.

Issues that came up during the project, getting the CSS to look good and fitting for the webpage by making sure the buttons and the text were in line and in the center of the page, however, I came across a reoccurring problem when I change the style of the webpage it would disable the JavaScript from actioning and nothing would work. Along with this making sure the spacing was correct and not squashed together or off-center, however, I was finding difficulty in making everything fit and to not looking scrappy.


UPDATE! 

Upon getting this project marked, I was able to see that I should go back and work on making the original plan that I had in mind. So I decided to clean up the design however still keeping it simple. The background color is off-white with black buttons for the options "Rock", "Paper" and "Scissors" when hovering over the buttons they highlight a shade of lavender so that the user knows what button they are selecting. I added a set of rules so that the player knows what beats what. Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, Scissors beats Paper and if the same option is selected then it is a tie. Along with this, a score is kept that will reset after three games played making it a best 2 out of 3 wins the game.
